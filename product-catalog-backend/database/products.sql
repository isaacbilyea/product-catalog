(2, 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle', 'Japan''s most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.\n\nIn a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife''s missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan''s forgotten campaign in Manchuria.\n\nGripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.', 10.99, 'Fiction', '2025-06-24 15:18:52', '2025-06-25 15:39:19', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GtJIryZJL.jpg', 'Haruki Murakami'),
(5, 'Convenience Store Woman', 'The English-language debut of one of Japan''s most talented contemporary writers, selling over 650,000 copies there, Convenience Store Woman is the heartwarming and surprising story of thirty-six-year-old Tokyo resident Keiko Furukura.\n\nKeiko has never fit in, neither in her family, nor in school, but when at the age of eighteen she begins working at the Hiiromachi branch of "Smile Mart," she finds peace and purpose in her life. In the store, unlike anywhere else, she understands the rules of social interaction―many are laid out line by line in the store''s manual―and she does her best to copy the dress, mannerisms, and speech of her colleagues, playing the part of a "normal" person excellently, more or less. Keiko is very happy, but the people close to her, from her family to her coworkers, increasingly pressure her to find a husband, and to start a proper career, prompting her to take desperate action…\n\nA brilliant depiction of a world hidden from view, Convenience Store Woman is an ironic and sharp-eyed look at contemporary work culture and the pressures we all feel to conform, as well as a charming and completely fresh portrait of an unforgettable heroine.', 8.48, 'Fiction', '2025-06-25 15:46:40', '2025-06-25 15:46:40', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680105376i/36739755.jpg', 'Sayaka Murata'),

Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of 19th-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, the authors explain how we are all free to determine our own future free of the shackles of past experiences, doubts and the expectations of others. It''s a philosophy that''s profoundly liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change, and to ignore the limitations that we and those around us can place on ourselves.\n\nThe result is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance.
